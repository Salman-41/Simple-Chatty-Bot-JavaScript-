# Simple-Chatty-Bot-JavaScript-
This code is an interactive program that simulates a conversation with a chatbot. It consists of several functions:

    greet(bot_name, birth_year): prints a greeting message with the name and birth year of the chatbot.
    remind_name(): asks the user to input their name, then prints a message with their name.
    guess_age(): asks the user to input the remainders of dividing their age by 3, 5, and 7. It then calculates the user's age using a formula and prints a message with the age.
    count(): asks the user to input a number, then counts from 0 up to that number, printing each number along the way.
    test(): asks the user a multiple-choice question about programming and gives feedback based on the user's answer. It will keep asking the question until the correct answer is given.
    end(): prints a congratulatory message to the user.

The code uses the sync-input package to get user input synchronously (i.e., the program waits for the user to input something before continuing).
